### Project: EEG Data processing and classification (CANCELED)  

This topic were not chosen because the data loading was tricky and also my data was credential. 


Useful links for project:  

* [MNE in Python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python), for MEG and EEG analysis and visualization  
* [MNE website](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html#)  
* [MNE dev](https://mne.tools/dev/index.html)  
* [MNE dev installation guide](https://mne.tools/dev/install/manual_install.html#manual-install)  
* [MNE installation guide](https://mne.tools/0.23/install/index.html)  
* [example from my MATLAB/EEGLAB code](https://bitbucket.org/iscab/bci_naovibe_footrace/src/master/EEG-analysis-script/scripts/ana01_filt_coaNAO.m)  


### Project: Image Super Resolution  

This topic is chosen because of data availability. 

Hints:  

* Super-Resolution  
* ResNet: Residual Network  
* Skip-connection  
* Batch Normalization  
* Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)  
* Structural similarity index measure (SSIM)  
* Image Quality metrics  
* Matplotlib  


drizzle algorithm:  

* suggestion "in astronomy one commonly uses a drizzle algorithm, perhaps you want to put that in as some layer?"  
* [Linear Reconstruction of the Hubble Deep Field](https://www.stsci.edu/~fruchter/dither/drizzle.html), explaining drizzle algorithm  
* suggestion "i suspect a working approach would be to apply drizzle 4x to enlarge the picture linearly and then apply a neuronal network, perhaps with convolutions in otder sharpen the image and make it smaller. the result is then a 2x larger image which is sharp"
