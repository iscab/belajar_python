Lesson learned

In this project, I am focusing on Logistic Regression and Gaussian-Bayesian

ICA and PCA have no difference for wine data to help the logistic regression.
The reduced dimension after PCA/ICA make the fitting process of logistic regression faster.

The hardest part for me is data visualization (plotting). 

I also have problem using classes and dataframe at the same time. 
So in my work, I didn't use new classes.

The Bayesian models are tricky. At first I used categorical Bayesian, but the inputs had to be categorical.
So I changed the model into Gaussian-Bayesian.

I would like to use k-Nearest Neighbour for next time.
I would like to use Logistic-regression for next time.
